#### Experimenting with Mods

Like last season, we decided to create a separate world to test our mod list again to ensure stability, compatibility, and playability. This one was significantly longer than the previous one, since we were still waiting on a lot of these mods to update to 1.21.5.

#### Geese Cafe in the End

We built a spruce cafe on a remote end island, mainly to experiment with the Macaw's mod set. We then expanded it by building a small town around it to provide it some much needed context and constructing a large wall to keep out all of the ~~black people~~ Endermen from our cute home.

There was also an ice rink outside of the geese cafe. We had ice skates from the Frostiful mod, whiched allowed us to skate on blue ice at really high speeds. DmmD then proceeded to accidently blow it up with a power 100 fireball.
