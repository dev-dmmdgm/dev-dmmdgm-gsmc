#### Time for Even More Mods

Season 5 celebrated the third anniversary of Geesecraft! This season, we included even more mods to our list, such as **Cobblemon**, **Mine Cells**, **Traveler's Backpack**, and **Hephaestus**, just to name a few. With a lot more experience from **Tech Reborn** and **Applied Energistics 2** from last season, progression became much more painless in this season as well.

#### Now THAT'S the Definition of Rich

With the help of our mods, we quickly industrialized and gathered a ton of resources by the first month of the season. We simply couldn't allow ourselves to get beaten by our past selves progression wise. That would be an absolute embarassment to us in the history of Geesecraft. Therefore, our mission? An adjustable SU.

We also blew our records for netherite completely out of the water compared to the last season. All we had to do was to mine out the entirety of the nether floor. :3

#### The Bee Movie

We also installed **The Bumblezone** mod this season, which, as the name suggests, added a whole new dimension solely about the bees. It didn't have much content unfortunately, since it was more of a showcase mod than anything else, but it was nice to finally see another dimension that wasn't just essentially a replica of the overworld.

#### Another Attempt At Space

Last season, we didn't fully understand how **Ad Astra** worked and sort of just flew to random planets for fun. This time was different. We were prepared. By that, we mean we did some more wiki searching. Apparently, there were also strongholds that we could loot to get upgraded rocketships and moon cheese. <sub>(YES! MOON CHEESE! INCREDIBLE, I KNOW!)</sub> So, that's exactly what we did.

Eventually, we made it to the final tier of the rocketship, only to be disappointed by the realization that the mod developer had never finished the mod beyond that point. None of the late-game planets had interesting to offer. No custom terrain or dangerous mobs attacking us. Nothing. They were just clones of the moon world but with a different atmosphere. Regardless, we still had plenty of fun going into outerspace and experiencing the low gravity on the moon.

#### The Last Season of Geesecraft

Season 5 would be the last season of Geesecraft <sub>(Source: Trust me.)</sub>, since both iiPython and DmmD had graduated highschool at this point. With the two main players going off into college, the server would most likely descend into silence. It was fun while it lasted.

May Geesecraft rest in peace. o7
