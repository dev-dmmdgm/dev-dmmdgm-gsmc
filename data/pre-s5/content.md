#### Mod-Testing in Progress

Welcome to the pre-season of season 5. Technically, this is not a true season, since we were allowed creative mode for mod testing. However, we did save this world so you and I could look back into it in the future and see what kind of mess we did when we had unlimited powers. Also, it is worth noting that while a ton of mods were listed in the official mod list, you can just as easily enter this world with just Tech Reborn and Paladin's Furniture installed. Additionally, this season was composed of two separate worlds, one used for mod testing, and another one for creative building.

#### Building an Abandoned Ruins

iiPython and K4 thought it would be a fun idea to build an abandoned ruins together in the middle of an oak forest biome. This was the result!
