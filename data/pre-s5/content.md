# Geesecraft / Pre-Season 5

This is the pre-season we played on prior to the launch of Season 5. It had the same mod list, however you can easily play the world with only Tech Reborn and Paladin's Furniture installed.

Keep in mind that most of the screenshots were taken by iiPython on 01/07/26, as not many existed previously.  
Also worth nothing is this season was composed of two different worlds, one used for mod testing, and one later just used for building in.
