#### Oop... Did I Say "Last Season" Last Time?

Well, we lied. Welcome to the actual last season of Geesecraft! Season 6 (or CWIL) is much different than the past seasons of Geesecraft in that it plans to be a four-consecutive-year season instead of a brief summer-break event. Additionally, it is now hosted by DmmD on Alvar instead of iiPython's dedicated server. This season will last for the full duration of DmmD's college life and will progressively update (while keeping the same world) as Minecraft does over time.

#### DmmD's Public Execution

DmmD was publicly executed on September 27th, 2025 for "intentionally" knocking iiPython into the void during an end city raid. Well, I say "intentionally". In reality, it was DmmD attempting to kill an endermite that spawned from an enderpearl throw and misclicking onto iiPython. <sub>(iiPython still claims it was an act of <a href="https://gsmc.dmmdgm.dev/data/s6/cold_blooded_murder.avif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"cold blooded murder"</a> to this day.)</sub> Regardless, DmmD was assigned to an anvil sentence by iiPython for his sins.

#### New Year Celebration (2026)

We celebrated the new year with some flashy fireworks. They were expensive as hell, costing eight diamonds and a shit ton of gunpowder that we didn't have.
