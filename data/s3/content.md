# Geesecraft / Season 3

Ah yes, Season 3. This season started with DmmD and iiPython spawning in on an island in the middle of nowhere, heading east, until they set up shop on a nearby landmass.  
From there, a farm was created outside of the main base (a simple wooden hut at the time), and DmmD setup a shop to sell fish. We also expanded further to the east, making a trading center with over 20 villagers held in captivity.

After beating the Ender Dragon, iiPython moved the base to a nearby beach while DmmD redesigned it to give it a more modern look.  
The season ended with a Gunpowder Farm, Squid Farm (Non-functional), Drowned Farm, Iron Farm (efficient asf), Cobblestone farm, Shulker Farm, Tree Farm, & Wither Skeleton farm.
