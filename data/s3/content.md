# Geesecraft / Season 3

## "Geesecraft s3 gonna be lit." - iiPython

#### It's Summer... Spring Again!

After spring break in 2023, we decided to launch another season of Geesecraft, breaking away from our two-year routine of summer-only seasons.

Initially, we were debating whether we should delay it until summer again to maintain our streak.
We thought it would be weird to start it when not everyone was available to play on the server.
However, we sort of missed the experience of Geesecraft so much that we eventually decided to start it anyway.

The cherry on top? This would give us a similar amount of time to enjoy some Minecraft as the other two seasons!
Therefore, in a sense, we were still continuing the tradition, heh.

#### First Home

We spawned in an island in the middle of nowhere.

After swimming to the nearest land mass eastwards, iiPython built a cute lil' house by the shores and named it "iiPython's House".

Then, a fish market was set up next door, selling fish. (FISH!)

#### ~~iiPython~~ Emy's Farm

Emy decided to "take over" iiPython's wheat farm and "upgrade" it a lil' bit.

#### Arctic Moment

K4 decided to base in a snowy spruce biome.

He even tamed a lil' fox.

#### New Members!

We also had a few new temporary members joining Geesecraft this season, namely, **Fepi** and **Rock**!

Fepi built a house before she disappeared forever, and rock swam in Emy's aquarium for some reason.

#### The Industrial Revolution

Over the course of two seasons, we gradually got hold of this game quite well.
We were also increasingly realizing that we were struggling to keep up with our resource supplies.

The solution? We began to farms everywhere, and I mean, **everywhere**.

We built a 99.9% efficient iron farm by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/@NicoisLOST" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nico is LOST</a>.
It utilizes the nether portal to trick Minecraft into spawning iron golems at near therotical maximum rate, giving us an almost infinite amount of iron by the end of the season.

We also built an extremely overpowered XP farm by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BlazeDude" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlazeDude</a>, which was a significant upgrade to our failed XP farm from last season.

There's the shulker shell farm by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Shulkercraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shulkercraft</a> as well. We even dug a long ass tunnel to migrate the shulkers all the way from spawn to the farm three thousand blocks away.

The farm broke like eight times during construction as well, so yeah...
To say the least, it was a pain in the goose to build in survival.

<img src="https://gsmc.dmmdgm.dev/data/s3/gallery/shulker_chaos.avif"/>

I think the main reason why it broke is because we didn't have chunk loaders back then, so whenever someone unloads the chunks to the farm, it breaks instantly.

But wait, there's more.

The totem farm by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NoSamurai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NoSamurai</a> gave us plenty of totems to work with.

Obviously, we can't forget the wither skeleton farm by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@moretingz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moretingz</a>!
It took us a while to make it, but it was 100% worth it - it made us very, very, VERY rich in beacons.

#### Wither? More like absolutely REKT!

We were so rich in wither skeleton skulls and iron blocks, in fact, that we decided to have some fun with it.

<iframe style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-zbo6b8gVI" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Yeah, the withers were no match against our army of iron bois.

#REKT.

#### Warden Raid

We also visited the deep dark for the first time this season.

We used some *unusual* techinques to find it.

It was scary, especially since we didn't even have netherite gear at the time.

#### Ocean-Side House

We built a modern concrete building near the ocean.
It had a swimming pool, a dining table, a kitchen, a world map of our surroundings, and also a bedroom on the second floor.

Here's an image of iiPython staring into the sunset with a dragon head that we stole from one of the end ships.

And here's a video of us blowing it up after the season, too.

#### Until Next Time

By the beginning of summer, we had done everything that we could in vanilla Minecraft.
We got automatic farms everywhere, built a humble house where we can vibe and rest, accumulated a respectable wealth in our storage, and even collected most of the advancements in the game.

Things were getting stale, to say the least.

That's why we had decided to introduce mods for the next season.
Hopefully it would be a lot of fun to experiment with brand new items and mechanics in Minecraft.

Until next time~ <sub>(Which was literally in 2 weeks.)</sub>
