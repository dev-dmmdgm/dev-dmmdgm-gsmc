# Geesecraft / Season 3

#### Wait, A Spring Season?

Yes, you saw that correctly. Season 3 wasn't the typical summer-break season like the two previous seasons we had on Geesecraft. It began right before the spring break of 2023, and it was meant to be a stress relief before we start a new legitamate season in the summer again. (We did have a debate on whether we should hold this season until summer, but maybe we were just a little bit too addicted to Geesecraft, so here we are with season 3 in spring!)

#### First Home by the Shores

This season spawned us on a remote island in the middle of nowhere. Since there weren't any trees on the island, we swam east until we found a proper land mass. iiPython constructed his first house by the shores, and DmmD and Emy, as always, settled in like parasites and claimed part of it as their own.

DmmD also built a fish shack in front of iiPython's house, where he would sell fish <sub>(FISH!)</sub> for a few iron ingots. Fishing became DmmD's hobby throughout the season, even though he was never able to catch enough fish to properly restock his barrels. The price tag was mainly for show. Anyone was allowed to take fish for free.

#### ~~iiPython's~~ Emy's Cute Wheat Field

iiPython originally had a wheat field around his house so he could sustain himself (and his parasites) with enough food during the early phase. However, Emy took that personally and decided that she wanted to give his wheat field a tiny little upgrade.

Excessive? Nuh uh! This is Geesecraft we're talking about after all. Either don't have enough or go crazy with it.

#### Arctic Lover As Always

K4 joined the server a few weeks after the season had already begun. Once again, he chose to build his base far, far away in a snowy spruce biome. We had to rely on elytras just to navigate between our main base and his home. (Oh well.)

<img src="https://gsmc.dmmdgm.dev/data/s3/gallery/arctic.avif">

Oh, he also tamed a lil' fox as his buddy. Look at how cute it is. (It took us a while to find a snow variant.)

#### New Members Joining the Squad!

This season, we welcomed two new temporarily members to Geesecraft, **Fepi** and **Rock**!

Fepi built a cool wooden house before disappearing forever. Rock took a good swim in Emy's aquarium for some reason.

#### The Industrial Revolution!

Two years of Minecraft had taught us a lot about the game, but it also led to us realizing that simply gathering resources by hand was not a viable solution in the long term. The solution? Industrialization!

The first problem we encountered was that we were constantly running out of iron. Solving this deficiency was especially important because it meant we could finally trade with villagers in bulk to get lots of emeralds. Additionally, much of Minecraft's crafting recipes rely heavily on iron, such as hoppers, anvils, and many other decorational blocks. In other words, not having enough of it was significantly slowing down our progression on this world. Naturally, as geese, we decided to go overboard with it. We built a 99.9% efficient iron farm designed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/@NicoisLOST" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nico is LOST</a>, capable of generating iron golems at the game's near theoretical limits using the power of nether portals. Simply put, it was able to provide us with an infinite supply of iron any time we wanted. (Like seriously, we literally had 10 shulker boxes of iron **BLOCKS** by the end of the season. We had no idea what to use it for anymore.)

Seeing how miserably our previous iteration of the XP farm had failed last season, we realized a typical mob farm was no longer enough to sustain our experience needs, especially after we could get our hands on the mending enchantment. Instead, we went with an enderman XP farm designed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BlazeDude" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlazeDude</a>, which was so efficient that it could get us to level 30 in less than five minutes. We also moved our entire enchanting setup to the end so it would be easier to stack enchantments when needed.

Portable storage was a huge issue as well. We thought installing plugins that forces every shulker to drop two guaranteed shulker shells would be too close to cheating. As a result, we needed a new way to mass produce shulker boxes. Introducing the all new shulker shell farm, designed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Shulkercraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shulkercraft</a>. The project was so tedious that it took us about eight hours to complete. We even had to dig a long ass tunnel just to migrate the initial shulkers all the way to the farm three thousand blocks away from spawn. Needless to say, it was an absolute pain in the goose to build it in survival.

Oh, and by the way. It kept breaking for some reason. I think it was because because we didn't know how to build active chunk loaders back then, so whenever someone tried to unload the chunks with the farm in it, it would break instantly.

Another farm we built was the totem farm, designed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NoSamurai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NoSamurai</a>. Its main goal was to reload us with plenty of totems of undying, since we sucked at the game so much. We also recreated the **Box o' Totems** from last season for the funsies. No, wait... We recreated **THREE** of them because 🖕🖕🖕. #NoDeathHereFolks :3

On a more serious note, though, it also gave us plenty of emeralds for the villager trading center.

The wither skeleton farm was probably the most impressive one we had on the season. We followed a tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@moretingz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moretingz</a>, which required us to find a nether fortress in the soulsand valley for maximum efficiency. We also had a wall where we would place each wither skeleton skull we obtained from the farm to flex our wealth. It was filled up after three days of grinding. In other news, we were very, VERY rich in beacons (thanks also to our iron farm).

There were a lot more farms that we built over the season, which we could not go over one by one. You can find a complete list along with the tutorials that we followed for each of them below.

#### Wither vs. Some Chunky Iron Bois (Who Would Win?)

We were so rich in wither skeleton skulls and iron blocks by the end of season that we decided to have some fun with them. We climbed all the way to the nether roof, constructed an obsidian chamber, and summoned a bunch of withers and iron golems to watch them battle each other.

<iframe style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-zbo6b8gVI" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Yeah, the withers were no match against our army of iron bois. #REKT

#### Check Out This Fat Warden, Guys!

We visited the deep dark for the first time this season. We honestly didn't know what to expect, since we never paid much attention to the recent Minecraft changelogs. As preparation, we brought with us a bunch of totems of undying, golden apples, and the best diamond gears we had. We also used some *unusual* techniques to find it.

<img src="https://gsmc.dmmdgm.dev/data/s3/gallery/ancient_city_glitch.avif">

Turns out, it wasn't as scary as we had initially imagined. Sure, the warden did deal a <sub>~~shit~~</sub> ton of damage to us, but it was overall manageable.

#### A Casual Ocean-Side House

Remember the starter house that we built at the very beginning of the season? It was finally time to build a new one now that we were much richer than before. This time, we decided to go with a modern style beach house as our next generation base. It featured a second floor for our massive bedroom and cactus farm, a basement with Emy's axolotl aquarium as the floor, and a swimming pool outside the building for the vibes.

Here's an image of iiPython staring into the sunset with a dragon head that we stole from one of the end ships in the background.

Oh, and here is a video of us blowing it up into smithereens after the season, too.

#### It's Summer! Time for Season 4!

We shutdown the server right before final exams so we could focus on studies. Season 4, which was also planned to be this summer, was going to be our first modded season. The main reason was because we had done nearly everything we could in vanilla Minecraft as semi-casual players. We had even gone as far as collecting every single advancement we could get in the game. There were truly no more content in the game that we hadn't tried at this point. It took us a while to playtest our mod list to ensure stability and playability, but hopefully it would be a lot of fun to experiment with brand new items and mechanics in Minecraft. See you there~!
