# Geesecraft / Season 4

## "Yes, we need more 1.20 mods." - iiPython

#### Welcome to Modded Minecraft

Season 4 is the first season we decided to introduce mods into the world.
Vanilla Minecraft began to feel boring to us, and it was summer again, meaning more time to play Minecraft.

Plugins didn't feel creative enough for us anymore, either.
They were definitely cool, allowing us to sit on stairs and ride on players, or giving us cool player heads for decoration, but they didn't offer the same amount of content as actual full-fletched mods.

That's why we switched our platform from Paper to Fabric.
We chose fabric because it was light, fast, and extensible, which was important since our computers weren't as powerful back then.
This also allowed us to install optimization mods that also helped with performance and chunk generation.

#### Technology and Infinite Power!!!

The two most exciting (and game-changing) mods we added were **Tech Reborn** and **Applied Energistics 2**.

Tech Reborn brought power and heavy machinaries into the game, which allowed us to automate many of the boring processes we struggled with in season 3.
We now have access to drills (3x3 mining abilities), nano swords and quantum armor (upgrade to netherite), jetpacks (separate mod that consumes TR power to give us flight ability), and UU-Matter (material synthesizer).

Applied Energistics 2 gave us a brand new medium for item storage.
It not only solved the issue of needing large amounts of chests for storage, it also provided a clean UI for sorting and filtering items and handled automations that Tech Reborned lacked, such as means to mine, plcae, pump, and transport resources.

#### Farmer & Chef DmmD

We also added **Croptopia**, which introduced a variety of new fruits, vegetables, and food to the menu.

For some reason, DmmD was especially into the corn in this mod and even constructed a corn empire out of it.

There's also the McGeese, which served as our one-and-only fast food restaurant on the server.

#### Ad Astra and Beyond

Tell me, who was the first goose to step foot on the moon?
That's right, it's Goos Wingstrong!

With **Ad Astra** (and **Agape Space** but we don't talk about it), we became the first group of geese to ever land on the moon and colonize its surface.
We built a cool lil' dome out of glass, brought our internet over using interdimentional ME gateways, and drove around the moon on our vrooming rover.

And here's K4 randomly suffocating without his space suit on the moon.

There were other planets too, and we visited each one of them.

#### I WANT MORE UU-MATTER!!!

Our mass industrialization had one downside: we were eating up way too much of our supplies.
So? We ramped up our UU-Matter production just *a little bit* <sub>(source: trust me)</sub> by the end of the season.

Unfortunately, due to a lack of wool, time, and power, we could only properly set up one of the four sides.
Despite this, we were able to generate more than enough UU-Matter to create almost anything in the game by mid-August.
It was our first time experiencing what it is like to be absolutely filthy rich. :3

#### End of Yet Another Season

Honestly, it was a pretty fun season.

We didn't have a lot of experience with modded Minecraft then, but it was still relatively fun to try out new features and mechanics that the Minecraft modding community had to offer us.

Now that we knew what modded Minecraft is like, we could definitely ramp up our mods for next season!
