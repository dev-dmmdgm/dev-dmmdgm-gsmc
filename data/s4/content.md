#### The Era of Modded Minecraft

Welcome to Season 4! This season marked the second anniversary of Geesecraft, and it was also the first season that we had decided to introduce mods into this game. We specifically changed our platform from Paper to Fabric to make this happen! The reason why we chose Fabric over Forge or Neoforge was because Fabric was designed with lightweight and performance in mind. It was also compatible with more mods compared to the other two mod loaders. Either way, we didn't want to include too many mods for this season, since we didn't know at the time how well the server could handle them. This was the experimental season, after all, sort of like the precursor season before we tried anything crazy.

#### Technology and Infinite Power!!!

The two most exciting and game-changing mods that we added this season were none other than **Tech Reborn** and **Applied Energistics 2**.

Tech Reborn solved one of the core issues that we had in the previous seasons, which was the fact that vanilla Minecraft heavily lacked fresh content for us to experiment with all the time. This mod introduced industrial machinaries, generators and electricity, and nano-technology weapons and geras for us to try our hands on. Progression through Tech Reborn was also much lengthier compared to the base game, which was good news since it meant we could finally jump out of the two-week Minecraft phase and focus more on the long-term goals over the entire duration of the season.

Applied Energistics 2, on the other hand, tackled a more fundamental problem that exists in almost every Minecraft server - storage. As the season progressed, our storage became more and more unmanageable. Items were scattered in multiple different chests across multiple different locations, and sorting became a pain. AE2 meant we could dump everything into one centralized storage unit and never have to worry about not being able to find our items ever again. It also had the added benefit of bringing internet into the game with wireless technology.

Although, AE2 did take a lot of power to run, especially in the late game when we were trying to set up interdimensional gateways. So, we agreed to specialize our tasks. **iiPython** took the job of managing TR-related progressions and generating enough power for AE2, while **DmmD** handled the networking and storage expanding portion of AE2.

#### And Then... Agricultural Revolution?

DmmD wanted a food mod really badly for some reason, so **Croptopia** was added specifically to entertain him. It introduced a variety of new fruits, vegetables, and cooked meals to the ~~menu~~, I mean game. Later, he became especially obsessed with trying to establish a corn empire after he found his love of his life - corn bread.

To complement with Croptopia, McGeese was built right next to DmmD's incomplete house. It served as our one-and-only official fast food restaurant on the server.

#### Ad Astra and Beyond

Tell me, who was the first goose to step foot on the moon? That's right, it's Goos Wingstrong!

**Ad Astra** (and **Agape Space** technically, too, but we don't talk about it) added galactic exploration to Geesecraft by guiding us to build complicated rocketships and launching our brave astrogeese into outer space! After struggling a bit to establish temporary oxygen in our lunar shelter, we became the first group of geese to ever step foot on the moon and colonize its surface. We even brought our internet over using the interdimensional ME gateway so we could truly access our items anytime, anywhere&trade;. Oh, in case you were wondering, there were moon rovers in this mod! Naturally, we took the opportunity and vroom'd at mach 10 till the following dawn like some drunk goos on bread because why not. :3

And here's K4 randomly suffocating without his space suit on the moon. <sub>(Don't ask, okay. I don't know either.)</sub>

There were other planets, too. We visited each one of them, but sadly none of them were as interesting as the moon. Space mod developers do just be lazy like that, what else can I say?

#### UU Matter in Production

In case you didn't know, **UU Matter** is the magical power that allows us to craft virtually anything in this game. Think of it like the fundamental building ~~block~~ dust for everything in this blocky universe. However, the problem? It took forever to even generate a single one of this dust. Recyclers don't have a guaranteed chance to produce scraps, and you need a crap ton of scraps to get just one UU matter. It was expensive as hell. Our solution was this abomination.

<img src="https://gsmc.dmmdgm.dev/data/s4/gallery/uu_factory_1.avif"/>

It is essentially a cobblestone generator. The contraption generates cobblestone from water and lava, which AE2's destruction panels mine and pick up to transport into an autocrafter. It then turns cobblestones into cobblestone slabs, doubling the item count essentially, and feeds them into the recycler. In other words, prepare to be forever rich in UU matter for this season!

Unfortunately, due to a lack of wool (needed for thicker cables) and power generation (too far from main base), we could really only properly setup one of the four sides that we had allocated for the contraption. Even then, it was enough to produce over **200 THOUSAND** UU matter by the end of the season, which was just simply insane.

#### Season Closure

Honestly, it was a pretty enjoyable season overall. We didn't expect mods would be this fun to play around with, so we would definitely be trying out more for the next season. Until next time!
