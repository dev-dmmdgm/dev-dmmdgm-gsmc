# Geesecraft / Season 1

## "Kachow, Geesecraft!"

#### The Beginning of the Beginning

Geesecraft began here in Season 1. It was a simple era back then; in fact, so simple that it wasn't even known as Geesecraft at the time.
Originally there were supposed to be two people, **iiPython** and **Matt**. However, for some reason, the latter could not show up. Requiring further testing to the server, **DmmD** was invited to the Minecraft world.

Soon, **Emy** joined the server as well. Together, we started to construct a small town called Goos Town. It had a few houses, a floating island, and a mini park. We also built a white concrete wall around the base to prevent hostile mobs from entering the region.

#### Extra Plugins

Well... Let's just say, we weren't exactly the best at the game back then.
In fact, we probably had keep-inventory <sub>and maybe even cheats (looks at iiPython)</sub> on to faciliate our lives and to accelerate progression during the season. We also had **EssentialsX** to get access to `/home`, `/nick`, and `/tpa` commands.

Of course, we had fun ones, too. We installed **PlayerHeads** to get cool player heads (duh) so we can go around and decorate our base a little.

#### Boat Game!!!

Its discovery was more or less an accident. Regardless, after realizing that you can deflect a boat on ice with a knockback sword, we swiftly made a mini ice rink to play a simple ping-pong / tennis game on it.

Since this season wasn't meant to be serious, we used `/enchant` on wooden sticks instead so the boats don't get destroyed as we play the game.

#### The Goos Police & The Secret Bunker

We got some netherite and began to create OP gears for ourselves.
Naturally, as geese, we decided to form a heroic squad to restore peace upon this chaotic land... and to kill each other for fun!

We also made a secret bank underneath the park as our secret bunker, where we would "host meetings" and store our valuables.

#### iiPython's House

iiPython built a house on August 3rd, which was recorded on video, apparently.

It was then struck by lightning, too... for some reason?

#### Farewell, OG Geesecraft...

Summer doesn't last forever, unfortunately, and the server was originally meant to be a test server anyway.
With school starting after the summer break, there was no way we could balance out Geesecraft with the constant pressure from school work.
Therefore, we made the difficult decision to call it a day for Geesecraft.
Maybe we can come back to it next summer. :3
