# Geesecraft / Season 1

## "Kachow, Geesecraft!"

#### Once upon a Time

All journeys once had a beginning, and Geesecraft's began here, in season 1.

It was definitely a simpler era back then, so simple, in fact, that it wasn't even known as Geesecraft at the time.

Originally, **iiPython** was going to invite **Matt** to test whether the multiplayer server was properly set up.
However, due to various reasons, Matt never ended up showing up to the server.
So, as a backup plan, iiPython decided to invite **DmmD** to fulfill Matt's role instead.
Little did iiPython know at the time, Geesecraft was about to get a lot crazier from that point on.

The server became public shortly after, and anyone was allowed on the whitelist with minimal questions asked.
**Emy** and **Ryan** (who did not own a Minecraft account) joined the server around this time as well.

Together, we constructed a small civilization called the Goose Town in the center of a spruce forest.
It had an apartment, a store with a pork vending machine in its basement, a floating island where iiPython called home, and a mini park, which we were really proud of at the time.
We also built a white concrete wall around the base to prevent hostile mobs from entering the area.

#### Extra Plugins

Now, we weren't exactly the best at the game when Geesecraft first began.
As a result, we also installed some plugins to make progression easier for us.

One of which was **EssentialsX**, a utility plugin that gave us access to commands, such as `/home`, `/warp`, and `/tpa`.
It was recommended by DmmD, and its purpose was to make navigation a lot less painful than needed.
Another one was **GSit**, which allowed us to sit on staircases, slabs, carpets, and even other players' heads.
Lastly, there's **PlayerHeads**, where we could get cool player heads to add more depth to our wall and desk decorations.

#### Boat Game!!!

Its discovery was more or less an accident, but it was a pleasant finding nonetheless.
We realized that you could deflect a boat on ice and give it a lot of velocity if you hit it with a sword.
And that was all it takes for us to invent a silly little game out of it.
Basically, it is a two-player game where each player had to use their knockback stick <sub>(did I mention we had cheats on for this season)</sub> to hit the boat into their opponent's goal, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_hockey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air hockey</a> if you will.

#### The Goos Police & The Secret Bunker

We got some netherite and began to create OP gears for ourselves.
Naturally, as geese, we decided to form a heroic squad to restore peace upon this chaotic land... and to kill each other for fun!

We also made a secret bank underneath the park as our secret bunker, where we would "host meetings" and store our valuables.

#### iiPython's House

iiPython built a house on August 3rd, which was recorded on video, apparently.

It was then struck by lightning, too... for some reason?

#### Farewell, OG Geesecraft...

Summer doesn't last forever, unfortunately, and it was originally meant to be a test server anyway.
School was starting for most of us, and there was no way we could balance out Geesecraft with constant school work.
Therefore, so we decided to end the season.
Plus, we could always come back to it next summer. :3
