# Geesecraft / Season 1

## "Kachow, Geesecraft!"

#### Where It All Started

Welcome to season 1 of Geesecraft, the original season where the roots of Geesecraft truly began.

It was a simpler era back then. There were no automatic farms, no complicated mods, not even progression-focused goals, just pure silliness and chaos. It was so simple, in fact, that it wasn't even known as Geesecraft at this time.

Originally, it existed because **iiPython** wanted to invite **Matt** to test whether his multiplayer server was properly set up on his cheap laptop. However, despite accepting his request, Matt never ended up joining. As a backup plan, iiPython chose **DmmD** as his alternative experiment dummy. Little did iiPython know, because of his decisions, Geesecraft was about to get a lot more crazy from that point onwards.

The server became semi-public shortly after. Anyone was allowed on the whitelist with minimal questioning. **Emy** and **Ryan** (who did not own a Minecraft account) joined the server around this time as well.

Together, we built a small civilization called the **Goose Town**, located in the center of a spruce forest. It had a three-story tall concrete apartment, a store in the corner with an underground porkchop vending machine in its basement, a two-level tall greenhouse to produce food, a spruce cabin where iiPython called home on a floating island, and a mini park with custom trees and pretty lanterns, which we were really proud of, by the way. (I mean, come on. It's literally the banner art for the season!) We also surrounded the base with a layer of stone bricks to prevent hostile mobs from entering the area.

#### A Couple Extra Plugins Wouldn't Hurt

Now, admittedly, we weren't exactly the best at the game when this season first began. So, we installed some plugins to help and make progression easier for us.

One of these plugins was **EssentialsX**, a utility plugin that gave us access to commands, such as `/home`, `/warp`, and `/tpa`. It was recommended by DmmD, and its purpose was to make navigation a lot less painful than needed. Another one was **GSit**, which allowed us to sit on staircases, slabs, carpets, and even other players' heads. Lastly, there's **PlayerHeads**, where we could get cool player heads to add more depth to our wall and desk decorations.

#### Da Boat Game!!!

Its discovery was more or less of an accident, but we realized that you could deflect a boat on ice and give it a lot of velocity if you hit it with a sword. That was all it takes for us to invent a silly little game out of it. It is basically a two-player game where each player must use their knockback stick <sub>(oops, did I mention we had cheats on for this season)</sub> to hit the boat into their opponent's goal, sort of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_hockey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air hockey</a> if you will.

We later upgraded the game by adding water streams on each side of the ice rink to make passing the boat to the serving player a lot more convinient. After the park was constructed, it was relocated to the center of the playground.

#### The Royale G.O.O.S.

After we got our hands on some netherite, we began to craft netherite gears to show off our power. We called ourselves the **Royale G.O.O.S.**. We held meetings and stored our valuables in a secret bunker made out of obsidian underneath the park.

We also designed shield patterns for our regime.

#### iiPython's New House

On August 3rd, iiPython built a brand new birch starter house next to DmmD's convenience store. The entire process was recorded with shaders on by DmmD in a YouTube video, which you can find below.

It was then later struck by lightning, too... for some reason?

#### Farewell, OG Geesecraft...

We decided to end the season after summer break was over. The server died down after school work began to pile on us, and we thought it would be quite pointless to continue hosting it when no one was able to play on Geesecraft anymore. Its official shutdown date was unfortunately lost to time, but we estinated it to be around September 15th.

Thus, the entire first season of Geesecraft concludes here.

o7, #Geesecraft.
