# Geesecraft / Season 2

## "Re:Geesecraft Moment"

#### Welcome Back!

We started season 2 of Geesecraft soon after summer break started in 2022.
This time, we set up some new policies to make Geesecraft more... *"official"*?
Basically, we would now have keep inventory off and also forbid everyone the usage of cheat commands.
I know, truly revolutional.

We spawned in a plains biome, where we would begin to construct our very beautiful Geese Town v2.
We build a barn for our tamed horses, a park reminiscing the original Geese Park, and even a newly improved boat game ice rink.
Since we didn't have cheats this time, we had to splash ourselves with weakness potions and use wooden swords to deflect the boats.
It did work, but it wasn't as fun as when we had knockback sticks in season 1. (Eh, at least it works, you know.)

#### First Taste at Industrialization

This is the first season where we actually designed farms to mass gather resources.
We didn't have the need in season 1 since we could just spawn items out of thin air <sub>(yeah...)</sub>.
Somewhere beyond the Geese Town, we have a **villager trading center** to get emeralds and golden carrots.
It wasn't exactly glorious, (nor does it work really), but it was enough to sustain ourselves for a while.

We build an **XP farm** high up in the sky, too! Well, okay, to call it an XP farm would be an over-exaggeration.
It didn't produce as much XP had we had hoped it would, but at least it gave us plenty of bones for bonemeal and gunpowder for rockets.
We also tried to build an automatic sorting system for the mob drops as a side project.
However, it unfortunately didn't go anywhere since we sucked at redstone, and we soon had to give up on it.

#### FBI Open Up!!!

Well, I guess this is where it all ends...

Due to a police raid, we lost the world saves for season 1 and season 2.
To this day, they still haven't returned the hard drive back to us.
At least we still got these screenshots.

With summer ending soon anyway, we decided to end the second season of Geesecraft.
