# Geesecraft / Season 2

## "Re:Geesecraft Moment"

#### Welcome Back!

Season 2 of Geesecraft began around the start of summer break in 2022.

This time, we made some new unofficial policies to make the game more fair for everyone. First of all, we would have keep inventory off so you couldn't use death as an escape ticket to everything. Second, we would lock the game difficulty to hard mode so villager trading halls would be possible. Lastly, we disabled all cheat commands. I know, truly revolutionary, but hopefully this would solve the issue of us constantly relying on *divine intervention* for everything we were too lazy to do ourselves.

Anywho, our spawn this season happened to be in a plains biome, which was nice because it meant we didn't need have to deforest the entire spawn area to begin building our starter houses. We built our very beautiful Geese Town v2 here, with a (half-finished) goose egg in the center for our beacons. We also built a barn in the center for our tamed horses, a park reminiscing the original Geese Park, again with custom built trees, and a newly improved boat game ice rink for our entertainment.

Something worth noting is that since we no longer had access to cheat commands, we unfortunately could not play the game with knockback sticks anymore. This was annoying because using any other weapons that can have the knockback enchant would instantly destroy the boat, making the game completely unplayable. Thankfully, we eventually realized that if we splash ourselves with weakness potions and use wooden swords as our paddles, it still works like a charm, saving the game from being lost forever.

#### First Taste at Industrialization

This was the first season where we actually designed automatic farms to gather large amounts of resources relatively quickly. Since we couldn't simply spawn in items out of thin air using `/give` anymore, this was absolutely essential so we wouldn't run out of supplies constantly while playing the game.

We had our first attempt at building a **villager trading center** somewhere nearby to collect emeralds and golden carrots. It didn't have any walls or decorations, just a re-floored flat surface where we trapped villagers in stone brick cages and forced them to trade with us unwillingly.

Since we also didn't have an iron farm this season, we had to resort to using melons and pumpkins to trade with farmers for emeralds and turning the profits into golden carrots instead. Naturally, with how slow melons and pumpkins grow in this game, we never had enough emeralds to fully restock our golden carrot supply in this season.

On another note, we also built an **XP farm** high up in the sky. Well, fine, to call it an XP farm would be an exaggeration. It was more like a semi-functional mob drop farm with an incredibly inconsistent efficiency depending on how many players were online at the time. You had to set your render distance to the lowest to get even get this XP farm to work at all. Needless to say, it didn't produce as much XP we initially had hoped it would. At least, on the bright side, it did give us plenty of bones and gunpowder for bonemeal and rockets respectively.

We also tried to build a redstone sorting system so it would stop clogging itself with damaged swords and bows. Yeah... it didn't go anywhere since we all sucked at redstone.

#### FBI Open Up!!!

Unfortunately, we lost the world saves for season 1 and season 2 forever. Due to a police raid, the hard drive containing the server data was confiscated and was never returned even to this day. Ever since this incident, measures to archive all of the following seasons have been significantly strengthened to prevent this from happening ever again.

Screenshots of season 1 and season 2 were recovered from Discord group chats, direct messages, and our Minecraft-Discord bridge channel.
